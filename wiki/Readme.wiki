Library of Javascript objects designed to retrieve data out of eID- and SIS cards using the applet from the eID middleware.

The interface and implementation (identity data) of EIDCard and SISCard are designed to be eID middleware independent.<br>
The interface and implementation of EIDCardBuilder35 and SISCardBuilder35 are designed for eID middleware 3.5.<br> 
The interface of CardReader is designed to be middleware independent.<br>
The implementation of CardReader uses EIDCardBuilder35- and SISCardBuilder35 objects and so it is designed for eID middleware 3.5.<br>

If a new EID middleware is released, only new EIDCardBuilder- and SISCardBuilder objects should be created and <br>
only small changes will need to be applied to the implementation of the CardReader.

The interface of CardReader, EIDCard and SISCard will not change.<br>
Therefore code that uses the CardReader-, EIDCard- and SISCard-objects will not have to be changed if a new eID middleware is released.<br>
 
The library is supposed to work on Windows in Internet Explorer 5.5 and higher, in Mozilla Firefox 2 and higher, and in Opera 9 and higher.<br>
Other browsers and other platforms were not tested.<br>

SIS cards can only be read when using a SIS card plugin. A SIS card plugin for the ACS ACR38U reader is available in the eID Quick Install.<br>
More information about SIS card plugins in the eID V3 middleware can be found at:<br> http://eid.belgium.be/nl/binaries/eid3_siscardplugins_tcm147-22479.pdf<br>

<B>How to run the examples</B>

  # Download the archive eidjavascriptlib.zip from http://code.google.com/p/eid-javascript-lib/
    * The archive contains the following subdirectories: examples, jsdoc and src.
    * Unzip the archive in a directory, for example c:\eid-javascript-lib<br><br>
  # Install eID software with the eID Quick install. Instructions can be found at
    * http://eid.belgium.be/nl/Hoe_installeer_je_de_eID/Quick_Install/ or
    * http://eid.belgium.be/fr/Comment_installer_l_eID/Quick_Install/<br><br>
  # Download Belgium Identity Card Developer's Kit (eID SDK 3.5) from 
    * http://eid.belgium.be/nl/Achtergrondinfo/De_eID_technisch/index.jsp or
    * http://eid.belgium.be/fr/Informations_legales_et_techniques/L_eID_d_un_point_de_vue_technique/index.jsp
      * Unzip the eID SDK 3.5 archive
      * Run the installer from the archive
      * Select the Common and JAVA feature to be installed.
      * Go to the installation directory of the eID SDK (C:\Documents and Settings\`<user>`\My Documents\Belgium Identity Card SDK)
      * Go to the subdirectory \beidlib\Java\bin of the installation directory.
      * Copy the following files to the examples subdirectory of the eid-javascript-lib:
        * Applet-Launcher License.rtf
        * applet-launcher.jar
        * beid35JavaWrapper-linux.jar
        * beid35JavaWrapper-mac.jar
        * beid35JavaWrapper-win.jar
        * beid35libJava.jar
        * BEID_Applet.jar<br><br>
  # Go to the examples subdirectory and open beid.jnlp in notepad or any other text editor.<br>The codebase directory should be changed to the examples subdirectory of the eid-javascript-lib:
{{{
   If your examples subdirectory is C:\eid-javascript-lib\examples\

   change 
	<jnlp codebase="http://127.0.0.1/" href="beid.jnlp"> 
   into 
	<jnlp codebase="file:///C:/eid-javascript-lib/examples/" href="beid.jnlp">

   This is also explained in readme.txt and copy_binaries.bat in the Samples\misc\Applet\Basic\java subdirectory of the eID SDK.
}}}
  # Open beid_java_plugin.jnlp in notepad or any other text editor.<br>The codebase directory should be changed to the examples subdirectory of the eid-javascript-lib:
{{{
   If your examples subdirectory is C:\eid-javascript-lib\examples\

   change 
	<jnlp codebase="http://127.0.0.1/" href="beid_java_plugin.jnlp"> 
   into 
	<jnlp codebase="file:///C:/eid-javascript-lib/examples/" href="beid_java_plugin.jnlp">

  # Open the examples in a browser.

<B>Remark</B>

  # The Base64 encoding only works in Internet Explorer, if JRE 6 Update 10 (Java Runtime Environment 1.6.0_10) or higher is installed<br>and if the Next-Generation Java Plug-in is enabled (this is the default setting) in the Java Control Panel.<br>The code for base64.js can be downloaded at http://hellerim.net/base64_src.php<br>More details about base64 encoding are explained in the examples example_picture.html and example_upload_picture.html<br><br>
  # If you are using Internet Explorer 7 or 8 on Vista to view the local examples files, it could be that the examples doesn't work.<br>Normally if you open the examples, saved in a directory on your hard disk, in Internet Explorer, there should be a warning:<br> *"To help protect your security, Internet Explorer has restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls that could access to your computer. Click here for options ..."*.<br>If this warning is not displayed, Java applets in that webpage are blocked.<br><br>The problem is caused by Protected Mode for IE7 and IE8 in Windows Vista.<br>More info about Protected Mode for Internet Explorer at: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/04/04/protected-mode-for-ie7-in-windows-vista-is-it-on-or-off.aspx<br><br>You can solve this problem using the following solution:<br>
    * Open the html-file.
    * Add a whitespace.
    * Delete the whitespace.
    * Save the html-file using a different filename.<br><br>
  # A foreigner eID card and a kids eID contains the same data as an eID card for Belgian citizens.<br>The only difference is the card number. A foreign eID card number starts with B. And a kids eID card number starts with 610.
